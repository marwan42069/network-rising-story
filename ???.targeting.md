*Richard has been building out his own network state. His endeavors have finally become impactful enough to draw the attention of United States President Ronald Thump and his technical advisor and confidante Yilong Ma. The two of them discuss a plan to squash Richard's movement and others like it.*

***Work in progress***

*October 7, 2026 — Palm Beach, Florida - Mar-a-Lago Club*

Two very rich and powerful men sat in two of the finest chairs money can buy inside of an incredibly massive and ornate African blackwood room with hand-carved wooden designs all along the walls. The golden light from the chandelier reflected all of the intricate designs decorating the walls.

President Ronald Thump gulped down a sip of Diet Coke and placed it on the glass and mahogany coffee table in front of his chair. He leaned forward to spread his knees and clasp his hands between his legs. "Look, Yilong, this guy \"oh - X - dickhead\" or whatever he calls himself, he's causing a lot of trouble. A lot of trouble. People are talking about him like he's the next big thing, a real hot shot. But you and I both know we can't have him undermining what we're doing here. We just can't."

Yilong sat motionless absorbing Thump's words. Being the most powerful immigrant in the world can be such a headache. "Yeah, I've been hearing about this "network state" movement. It's... interesting." He actually decide to lean back despite Thump's forward movement. "Decentralized communities, self-sustaining technology. It's a bold direction, but it interferes with a lot of our current structures. Government, corporations, everything. We have to figure out how to handle it before it gets too big."

"I tell you, this kind of thing, it won't just go away on its own. We've got to be strong." Thump reached for his almost empty can of Diet Coke. "And we have ways, very effective ways, of putting the brakes on these troublemakers. People don't realize how good we are at it. We're going to send our best, okay?"

Yilong paused. "And who's that?"

"The best from the FBI, top subversion agent. Vi Braeter." 

Yilong couldn't help himself. "Really?" He raised an eyebrow. "That's a unique name."

Thump continued unperturbed. "Great guy, terrific at his job, so good, definitely the best in the country. Maybe the best in the world!"

Yilong thought for a moment. "I get it. If this \"0xDickhead's\" plan keeps expanding, it's going to disrupt the entire system. The government, the economy, everything. If you want to keep America strong and stable, maybe infiltration is the pragmatic call."

"Absolutely right, Yilong! Absolutely. We do infiltration—quiet, but very effective. He won't see it coming. We'll get into his inner circle, find out who's financing this nonsense, and boom! Pull the rug out. You know, he thinks he's unstoppable, but nobody's unstoppable. Not when we have the best agencies. There's a reason we're number one."

Yilong then leaned forward. "I just want to make sure we're being strategic." He started with a hint of caution in his voice. "If we go too heavy-handed, it might backfire. But if we send someone with the right approach -- subtle, cunning, able to sow enough doubt -- then it could cool down this entire movement before it escalates. The decentralized platform he's building could get huge traction if we ignore it."

"Exactly. Subtle, but strong." Thump thumped powerfully on the glass almost as if he was trying to crack the table. "We can't let tghis dickhead outsmart us. This is America, we don't roll over for anyone. Not on my watch. Yilong, I've got Vi on speed dial. I'll make the call. And I'm telling you, once we set this plan in motion, we'll see Richard's decentralized dream fizzle faster than any of these so-called revolutions." Thump leaned back to reach into his pocket for his Galaxy Z Fold8.

Yilong dropped his hands to his sides. "I guess we'll have to see if your agent can handle it. Just make sure they're good at low-profile operations. I'd rather not see my name splashed around in the aftermath. For all the talk of decentralization, we still need a centralized approach to keep things on track."

Thump smiled confidently. "Don't worry. We'll keep it all under wraps. And when it's done, we'll be able to say \"oh - X - who?\" That's the plan. Thank you for being on board, Yilong. We're going to keep America on course, nobody does it better."

Yilong stood up abruptly, he'd been holding in his pee for about an hour. "Right. Let's just hope this is one of those missions that goes exactly as planned... for our sakes."

Thump leaned forward emphatically. "Hold on, don't go anywhere yet." 

Yilong groaned. Thump then eased back a bit and entered the dial shortcut to reach directly to Vi. He placed his phone to his ear.

*October 7, 2026 — Los Angeles, California - a small dingy apartment*

A short lean figure sat in an oversized recliner staring down locks of blonde hair they had violently shorn from their full head of hair, scattered to the sides of a fat line of pure Guererro cocaine. It had been one hell of a bender this weekend. 

*Thank fucking God I can at least sleep in tomorrow. That assignment in Ardakan was such a pain in the dickhole.* Vi has no dick hole, though they often wish they did. As they leaned forward and pressed a finger to their right nostrill, they saw the work phone ring. They needed only a fraction of a second to register that the President himself was calling. 

*Oh HELL no, what the fuck does he want." Vi let out an exasperated sigh. They took a deep breath, and right before the voicemail began, they pressed the button to accept the call.

"Talk to me." Vi always loved answering work calls like this, it never ceased to amuse them even after eleven years in the business. They didn't give a shit if they were receiving calls from their intern or the President himself.

"Vi, it's Ron. I think you understand we have a huge problem on our hands."

"I expect nothing less if you are directly calling my line instead of delegating it to Director Gay, Mr. President. So talk to me, what's going on?"
