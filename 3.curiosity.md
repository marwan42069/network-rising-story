# 3. Curiosity
*April 2, 2024 — 5:56 PM - Westerville, Ohio, United States - Rusty Bucket Restaurant and Tavern*

"Welcome to Rusty Bucket, boys. My name is Cynthia and I'll be taking care of y'all this evening." Richard, Yuri, and Eaton turned their attention to the busty waitress who arrived at their usual table. A relatively but not freakishly tall woman in her late thirties with a little extra cushion in all the right places stood in front of the gang with a calm but attentive look on her face. Yuri couldn't help but widen his eyes for an instant to take in the view of the lady's beauty.

"What would you like to start off drinking?" Cynthia turned and looked at Yuri. She picked up on his attraction but brushed it aside, as she usually does.

Yuri needed an instant to bring his focus towards her words instead of her body. "Yeah, uhhh, can I start with a Corona?"

"Sure, sweetie." Cynthia said with a slightly more polite and formal tone than she usually uses with patrons. She quickly noted Yuri's drink choice.

She then turned to Eaton. "What about you, hon'?" 

"I'll have a Coors Light."

"You got it." The waitress finally turned her head towards Richard, who was preoccupied playing Crypt of the Necrodancer on his phone. "Do you want anything to drink, hon'?" Richard didn't even acknowledge her presence. 

After several seconds of awkward silence, Yuri knocked on Richard's head. "Hey Dick, she's talking to you."

Richard finally started to look over his sunglasses to assess what the hell Yuri wanted. "Oh shit." Feeling a little embarrassed, he turned to look at the waitress. "Can I get a Blue Moon please?"

"You got it. I'll be right back with your drinks, fellas." Cynthia walked off to a nearby table.

Yuri furrowed his brow. "What are you all up in your head about this time, Dick?"

Richard looked for a second at Yuri and Eaton. They have been going out together to different bars around town to chill and drink almost every Tuesday evening for the past three years, ever since they became friends when working together at Volvo. Richard had left about nine months prior to lay low at Dover Consulting, but he continued to hang out with Yuri and Eaton as they stayed at Volvo. These guys were his compadres, his bois, his homies. 

"Guys, I fucking got laid off. Benjamin was like \"UnitedHealthcare changed their budget, so hit the road, chucklefuck.\" The motherfucker claimed he couldn't place me on another project either."

Yuri squinted at Richard. "When the fuck did that happen? No way he did it today on a Tuesday."

"It happened on Thursday." Richard sighed heavily. "Honestly, the past few days have been a blur through all the mamajuana and weed. I cannot fucking even right now." 

Yuri facepalmed. "Why the fuck didn't you tell us?" He extended his right arm out in exasperation. "I could have called up Rodrigo and had you back on the team the next day!"

Richard simply shrugged. "Like hell I'm going back. Enterprise makes me feel like a fuckin' automaton. Our work there doesn't matter for anything worth a damn and it doesn't do shit to make the world a better place. Not to mention how utterly fucking pointless it is to climb a corporate ladder, I spent way too much effort on that shit back at Volvo."

Yuri softened his tone, a rare moment for him. "Man, you don't have to do that above and beyond shit." He raised his right hand again to motion to himself and Eaton. "Just hang back and take it easy like me and Eaton while you plot your next move."

"Nah man, I wouldn't be able to forgive myself for going back. At least at Dover I could wear what I want and crack open a cold one after 4pm."

Eaton gathered his thoughts for a moment. "So let me get this straight. You got bent over by Ben Dover?" Both Eaton and Yuri started cackling like banshees. After a few seconds, Richard started to chuckle too. "Yeah, I fuckin' guess I did, didn't I?"

"The powers that be love to slap us around, huh," Eaton groaned. "I know Benny's a small guy next to the globalist elite but that's straight up horseshit."

"Yeah they fuckin' do. Maybe I should try to get a remote job and buy a little bungalow in Las Tarrenas. Fuck this bitch ass place."

"You're just bullshittin'." Yuri had to chime in with his opinion. "You've been saying that since you left Volvo. You could do it tomorrow if you wanted, Dick, and you know it."

The gang fell into silence for a few moments. Curiously, CNBC was airing on the TV in front of the gang's table. A newscaster was interviewing some guy from some company called MicroStrategi, and they were talking about Bitcoin.

Richard started to listen to the TV. "Bitcoin is at least digital gold. It's gonna eat gold. It's got all of the great attributes of gold and none of the defects of gold..." some guy called Michael Taylor or something droned on.

Yuri had been listening too, and he groaned again. "You know, I bought ten Bitcoins for $250 each when I was in college." *Here we fuckin' go.* Richard thought. 

"It fuckin' dropped to $140 a month later so I punked out and sold. That's almost seven hundred G's now!" He let out another exasperated sigh. "Motherfucker."

*I don't need this shit in my life right now.* Richard started to tune out and re-opened the game on his phone. 

Eaton put his hand on Yuri's shoulder. "It's for the best, bud. Bitcoin is like Zion from The Matrix — it's just a trap for the smarter NPCs." He eased back as he spotted the waitress walking briskly towards the table with the trio's drinks. "Thank GOD, our drinks are here."

"Here are your drinks, boys." Cynthia settled each of the gang's beer glasses in front of them. Richard once again snapped out of his gaming stupor when he noticed the aroma of hops at the table. "Thank you, ma'am."

As Cynthia started to walk away, Eaton picked up his glass. "The globalists are gonna take over Bitcoin like they took over the internet and our government. Yeah the number goes up, so what? Fiat money is worthless anyway, it all goes to zero." He took his first sip from the Coors in front of him. "Just buy guns, ammo, gold, sliver, and supplies. That way, when [the Happening](## "The Happening refers not to the poorly-received 2008 thriller film, but to a theoretical complete breakdown of modern society, whether through a single cataclysmic event or a series of degradations and failures in the global economic and communication network. This definition was popularized on 4chan.") happens and you can't use your Bitcoins in a world with no internet, you're not completely fucked."

Yuri slumped in his seat. "I guess I'm just gonna have to work until I die like everyone else."

Eaton smiled and put his hand back on Yuri's shoulder. "Don't worry buddy. When the Happening happens, you'll no longer have to work and then you'll truly be free from this system!" He then burst out laughing. Richard giggled too at the idea of Yuri celebrating not having to go to work in the event of a societal collapse. 

Richard shifted his attention between the CNBC interview playing on the TV and the homies' chatter. *Clearly motherfuckers are still making lots of money from crypto, otherwise they'd have just stopped talking about it forever ago, right?*

Richard leaned his face onto his palm, elbow on the table. *I don't know. Eaton has a point about the powers that be and the very real possibility of a societal collapse this century. And Yuri's just bumming me out. I know working sucks dong, but how else are you going to create the life you want? You gotta work hard.* He grimaced a bit. *If Yuri had a God damn shred of patience, he could be much more comfortable than he is. Or at least he can finally start buying good shit instead of those $39 bargain-bin ounce bags when we go to Ann Arbor.*

Richard looked back to the TV where they were previously watching that guy talk about Bitcoin. The discussion had switched to something about higher oil prices. *Nah, Eaton's right, it's just a bunch of bullshit.*
