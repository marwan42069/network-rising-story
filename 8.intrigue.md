*With a couple of Web3 projects under his belt, Richard gains the confidence to attend [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com)'s hackathon event. He builds an app that rewards people tokens for completing fitness challenges. His demonstration captures the interest of Mike Ropini, CEO of Networkia. Networkia is a network state project aiming to create free economic zones in which biomedical engineers can experiment with human longevity. Mike is inquiring about anyone in the hackathon building projects related to health and fitness. Mike is impressed with what Richard was able to build by himself over the hackathon duration, but the two really build rapport after Richard shares his vitriol for the health insurance industry. They discuss their shared distaste for the establishment, then they exchange contact information.*

# 8. Intrigue

*March 1, 2025 â€” Denver, Colorado, United States - National Western Events Center*

Michael Ropini could barely sit still at the judging booth's table. Not only could he feel the minutes escaping his maximum expected lifespan in his chair, but the presentations were total ass too. *Ugh, all these dumbass college kids with their AI slop. Broke zoomers just think they can slap it together with a free-tier OpenAI account.* 

Mike adjusted his perfectly tailored Networkia t-shirt on his perfectly sculpted lean torso and then wiped a trace of sweat off of the strikingly smooth skin on his forehead. After this little grooming moment, he instinctively started to reach for his phone until he noticed a skinnyfat Hispanic-looking dude with slicked-back hair and aviator sunglasses approaching his table. He withdrew his hand and then turned his focus to the guy walking up.  

Richard came to a stop about six inches from the front of Michael's table. He glanced over Michael and then his table. *Networkia: The Future of Experimentation, Today. Hmmm. What an unusual looking-ass motherfucker. His face looks almost artificial.* "Hi, I'm Richard."

Michael stood up, relieved Richard didn't ask him if he was related to Ryan Johnsson. "Pleasure to meet you Richard. I'm Michael. What are you building?"

"Let me show you!"

The two sat down in their chairs on opposite sides of the table. Richard shifted between the four chairs available in front of Michael's table and sat down in the second one from Michael's right. He then opened his laptop, signed in, and tilted it so that both of them could look at Richard's screen from either side of the table.

Mike examined the screen for a few seconds. "FitDrop? So you get airdrops... for fitness?"

"Yep, you sign up, connect a wearable account, and start working out. The more steps or cycling miles or whatever you get, the more tokens you receive. We've got a React Native frontend running with Expo, along with native builds for iOS and Android. Yes, they do work. And of course we've got our smart contracts deployed to Optimism Sepolia, and a Node Express API running a Kubernetes cluster running in Akash network."  

"And you are..." Michael squinted at the writing at the bottom of the hackathon badge around his neck. "0xDickhead?"

Richard smiled to himself. He straightened his back to sit a little taller and puffed his chest out. "That's right!"

Mike raised an eyebrow at him. "Did you lose a bet?"

Richard resisted the urge to snort. "No, actually. My last name is Cabeza, so it's a word play on my name."

Mike then softened his expression and sighed a little bit. "I can empathize. My last name is Ropini, so make of that what you will."

Richard thought for a moment and smiled very briefly to himself. "Yeah, so you sign in using whatever chain you want, whether you wanna transact on Optimism or Arbitrum or Polygon or..." Richard forced a cough. "Base."

Richard clicked on the "Sign In" button on the screen. "You can choose one of these test wallets I have set up."

Mike signed in and then clicked around a little bit in the iOS emulator running on Richard's computer. "Did you have some of this built already before coming to the hackathon?"

"Actually no! But I did have AI agents write the bulk of the code and then I examined and troubleshooted it and orchestrated the final app you see here."

Michael stopped playing with the app for a moment to probe Richard's motivations. His lead engineer The Dragon King needed some additional Web3 labor to build the [DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) that would fortify the financial and organizational sovereignty of their up-and-coming jurisdictions. "What motivated you to build this?"

On a whim, Richard decided to chuck his professionalism out the window. "To tell you the truth, I fuckin' hate the healthcare industry. I mean, I know everyone knows the industry sucks dick, but holy FUCK they slapped my shit several months ago after I got into a nasty car accident. Obviously, something like this won't change car accidents and whatnot, but we the people wouldn't have to give these fucks nearly as much money if we took better care of our health."

Michael's face brightened. *This guy has some fire in his belly, huh?* "You know something, I hate them too, man."

Despite his nearly unbreakable focus on posture, Michael slumped a little bit in his seat. "My parents died young from overwork and stress. I lost them both within seven months of each other. I was devastated, and I knew I wouldn't have lost them if this fucked up system treated root causes rather than symptoms. Your app seems like it's there to motivate people to be healthier, right?"
