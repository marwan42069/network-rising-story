*With a couple of Web3 projects under his belt, Richard gains the confidence to attend [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com)'s hackathon event. He builds an app that rewards people tokens for completing fitness challenges. His demonstration captures the interest of Mike Ropini, CEO of Networkia. Networkia is a network state project aiming to create free economic zones in which biomedical engineers can experiment with human longevity. Mike is inquiring about anyone in the hackathon building projects related to health and fitness. Mike is impressed with what Richard was able to build by himself over the hackathon duration, but the two really build rapport after Richard shares his vitriol for the health insurance industry. They discuss their shared distaste for the establishment, then they exchange contact information.*

# 8. Intrigue

*March 1, 2025 â€” Denver, Colorado, United States - National Western Events Center*

Michael Ropini could barely sit still at the judging booth's table. Not only could he feel the minutes escaping his maximum expected lifespan in his chair, but the presentations were total ass too. *Ugh, all these dumbass college kids with their AI slop. Broke zoomers just think they can slap it together with a free-tier OpenAI account.* 

Mike adjusted his perfectly tailored Networkia t-shirt on his perfectly sculpted lean torso and then wiped a trace of sweat off of the strikingly smooth skin on his forehead. He then instinctively started to reach for his phone until he noticed a skinnyfat Hispanic-looking dude with slicked-back hair and aviator sunglasses approaching his table. He withdrew his hand and then turned his focus to the guy walking up.  

Richard came to a stop about six inches from the front of Mike's table. He glanced over Mike and then his table. *Networkia: The Future of Experimentation, Today. Hmmm.* 

Richard then took one more moment to look at Michael. *What an unusual looking-ass motherfucker. His face looks almost artificial.* "Hi, I'm Richard." Richard extended his hand to shake.

Mike stood up, relieved Richard didn't ask him if he was related to Ryan Johnsson. "Pleasure to meet you Richard. I'm Michael." The two shook hands very briefly. "What are you building?"

"Let me show you!"

The two sat down in their chairs on opposite sides of the table. Richard shifted between the four chairs available in front of Mike's table and sat down in the second one from Mike's right. He then opened his laptop, signed in, and tilted it so that both of them could look at Richard's screen from either side of the table.

Mike examined the screen for a few seconds. "FitDrop? So you get airdrops... for fitness?"

"Yep, you sign up, connect a wearable account, and start working out. The more steps or cycling miles or whatever you get, the more tokens you receive. We've got a React Native frontend running with Expo, along with native builds for iOS and Android. Yes, they do work. And of course we've got our smart contracts deployed to Optimism Sepolia, and a Node Express API running on a Kubernetes cluster in Akash network."  

"And you are..." Mike squinted at the writing at the bottom of the hackathon badge around his neck. "0xDickhead?"

Richard smiled to himself. He straightened his back to sit a little taller and puffed his chest out. "That's right!"

Mike raised an eyebrow at him. "Did you lose a bet?"

Richard resisted the urge to snort. "No, actually. My last name is Cabeza, so it's a word play on my name."

Mike softened his expression and sighed a little bit. "I can empathize. My last name is Ropini, so make of that what you will."

Richard thought for a moment and smiled very briefly to himself. "Yeah, so you sign in using whatever chain you want, whether you wanna transact on Optimism or Arbitrum or Polygon or..." Richard forced a cough "Base."

Richard clicked on the "Sign In" button on the screen. "You can choose one of these test wallets I have set up."

"Did you have some of this built already before coming to the hackathon?" Mike asked as he clicked around in the iOS emulator running on Richard's computer. 

"Actually no! But I did have AI agents write most of the code and then I examined and troubleshooted it and then orchestrated the final app you see here."

Mike stopped playing with the app for a moment to probe Richard's motivations. He remembered for a moment that his lead engineer The Dragon King needed some additional dev labor to help build the [DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) that would fortify the financial and organizational sovereignty of their up-and-coming jurisdictions. This was the first guy he met so far that actually had something working and sensible, so he wanted to learn more about this guy's ideas. "What motivated you to build this?"

*Does this motherfucker really need to know WHY I'm building this? Whatever, it's not a secret or anything.* Richard decided to chuck his professionalism out the window. "To tell you the truth, I fuckin' hate the healthcare industry. I mean, I know everyone knows the industry sucks dick here, but holy FUCK they slapped my shit several months ago after I got into a nasty car accident. Obviously, something like this won't change car accidents and whatnot, but we the people wouldn't have to give these fucks nearly as much money if we took better care of our health."

Mike's face brightened. *This guy has some fire in his belly, huh?* "You know something, I hate them too, man."

Despite his otherwise nearly unbreakable focus on posture, Mike slumped a little bit in his seat. "My parents died young from overwork and stress. I lost them both within seven months." He paused for a moment.

"I'm sorry for your loss," Richard murmured politely. 

"I was devastated, but I knew in my heart I wouldn't have lost them if this fucked up system treated root causes rather than symptoms." Mike realized he was getting worked up in front of a stranger, so he relaxed a little bit. "You want to motivate people to be healthier, right?"

"Yeah, I guess I do. This seemed like a fun thing to build, but yeah, a healthier population means they extract less money from us, and that sounds like a win for me."

"Well Richard, at Networkia, we work with individuals and companies at the forefront of human lifespan longevity research and development to provide them organizations and ultimately safe economic zones to conduct their studies in. But the results of those studies need to serve human beings. And the first step in that process starts with getting people excited about healthy habits and behaviors so that the interventions whose development we facilitate will have the maximum impact."

Mike paused for a moment. "Have you heard of the network state?"

"No. What's that about?"

"Never mind that for now. Are you looking for a job? This is pretty impressive for a one-man effort, and we have an opening for a Web3 dev."

Richard's face brightened up, but then he tempered his excitement a bit. "I am open to opportunities that align with my talent and interest, yes," he said coolly.

Mike reached for his phone and tapped it against Richard's. "Here's my contact information. I'd like to get to know you and your motivations a little better, Richard. Maybe we're aligned enough to work together."
