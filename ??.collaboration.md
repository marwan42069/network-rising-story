*Mike sends Long and Richard to Abu Dhabi to a network state conference in order to scope out related projects who could collaborate and VCs who could invest more money into Networia. Richard has been forming his own opinions on what the network state means, so in his mind, he is there not for Networkia, but for himself to piece together all of the intertwining and parallel efforts. Richard is disappointed with the crazy people he meets until he stumbles upon someone who can help him put it all together.*

***Work in progress***

*December 15, 2025 - 1:32 PM — Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - Etihad Arena, main auditorium*

"Thank you again for having me here, now let's work together to make death a choice!" The remote speaker turned off his camera to indicate he was finished with his talk. 

The audience roared in applause. Some people towards the front even stood up. Despite their company's alignment with the speaker's agenda, Richard and Long remained seated with their laptops open in their laps, neither of them applauding. The pair was tasked with taking notes and networking with people with viable longevity projects on Michael's behalf, but they each had other things on their minds. 

_Zooko might be able to point me to someone who can help me design this API._ Long was ascertaining who from the speakers might be technical enough to help him figure out how to securely expose data from Networkia's hypervisor to the LLM sentinel.

_Are any of these motherfuckers NOT just here to pitch their companies to VCs?_ Richard pressed his palm against his cheek. _Bitch ass shills._

Richard turned to Long with a quizzical expression on his face. "I thought these were supposed to be great minds architecting the future of humanity. All these motherfuckers are just whoring themselves out for investment dollars."

"We're strolling that street corner too, mate." Long looked back at Richard. He pointed to Richard's Networkia t-shirt and then at his own.

The applause finally quieted to a halt. Many of the people who stood up to applaud the speaker moved out of their seats towards the auditorium exit. 

Richard rolled his eyes. "Michael should have gotten his ass here instead of us. I don't want to listen to these shills circlejerk their meaningless projects."

"Well, feel free to get off your bleeding arse and talk to the other patrons." Long couldn't suppress his scowl quickly enough.

Richard grimaced and recoiled a little bit. "Damn bro, yell at me why don't you." Out of the corner of his eye, Richard suddenly registered that the crowd was really thinning out.

Long softened his expression a bit. "Honestly man, I don't mind taking technical notes if you want to talk to people about their projects. Just don't forget we're at work here."

Richard groaned a little bit. He then closed his laptop, rose from his seat, and tucked his laptop under his right arm. "Now that everyone's seen that guy talk, maybe there'll be more interesting people to talk to about their projects."

"So you're building a business platform for African workers to access the European market?"

Hans placed his first two forefingers on his temple. "It's so much more than that." He sighed a little. "We are providing an equitable virtual nation to empower skilled and ethical individuals and businesses all around the world!" 

"But you just told me all about your work in Senegal and Ghana and Ethiopia encouraging the developers in these countries and connecting them to European businesses, you mentioned very little of the nation part and how this isn't just gonna end up as an economic race-to-the-bottom."

"We have our clusters! They do social good and contribute and vote on social good missions with which they are aligned!"

*Alright then, I'm done hearing about this guy's charity.* Richard looked at his watch as if to check the time for his next obligation. "I'm sorry man, I need to get going to the next talk." Richard stood up and extended his hand for a parting handshake. "Pleasure meeting you. *Auf wiedersehen*, buddy."

<hr />

"Oh, so you're into the whole longevity thing too? Our company is also on Ryan Johnsson's johnson."

Ayanah chuckled to herself. "Ryan Johnsson's on *my* johnson!" She thrust her thumb towards her chest. "He sent me a text message saying he wanted to invest in my company, so I told him more about it and I'm waiting for his reply!"

Richard furrowed his brow. *This bitch is fuckin' nuts.* "Riiiiiiiight. The man didn't tell you to lose his number?"

"For real! I walked up to him and said \"So do you wanna die? I'm THE only woman with the technology to preserve your current form for fifty years.\""

Richard remained skeptical. "And he didn't just ignore you or tell you to shove it?"

"*Hell* no he didn't, he knows better than that."

Richard's eyes widened. *I gotta get the fuck out of here.* "That's awesome. Hey, I have to get going, but maybe we can collaborate to build out the legal and organizational structure for your adherents." He stood up, pulling out business card out of his pocket. Richard never checks his work Telegram or Discord accounts. 

He placed the card on the table and immediately started stepping back. "Let's keep in touch, okay?" 

Before Ayanah had a chance to reply, Richard was already out of earshot. *Thank fucking God. I thought I was crazy, but clearly I haven't seen shit.*

<hr />

*December 15, 2025 - 4:13 PM — Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - outside the Etihad Arena building*

Richard stood outside cradling a cigarette between his fingers. He knew it was a bad look to be smoking while representing a company that builds infrastructure for human longevity, but he didn't care anymore. He needed to talk to the boys to vent about these crazy ass people. With his earbuds in his ears, Richard started a group call for him, Yuri, and Eaton. After a few rings, Yuri picked up.

"The hell do you want, Dick? I'm getting ready for work!" Yuri groaned as he was tucking his polo shirt into his pants

Eaton was already at the office, so he was unperturbed with the call. "How's it going in Dubai? Did you get to ride a camel yet?" He chuckled to himself. 

"First of all, I'm in Abu Dhabi. Second of all, I'm working, I don't have time for that shit. Though it does sound more fun than listening to these fucks." Richard let out a heavy sigh, almost disappointed to continue sharing his feelings. "You guys were right, these people don't know what they're doing."

"What did you expect from a bunch of shortsighted nerds who think they can control the future with magic internet money?" Yuri was always ready to roll with the cynicism. 

"Do any of those pansies even own any land?" Eaton chimed in.

"Nah man, these motherfuckers are so much wilder than that."

As Richard continued to vent about the vaporware and general insanity from the network state crowd, a short Italian guy was also walking away from the conference venue to get some fresh cigarette smoke-filled air. Up ahead, the Italian guy registered an animated Spanish-looking dude with aviator sunglasses yammering on about his disappointment in the conference. 

"Then this bitch was like \"Ryan knows better than to fuck with me.\" Like, bitch, who the fuck IS you? And don't get me started on this German guy I met who thinks he can build a network state with cheap African labor." Richard sighed again. "These motherfuckers are flat out LARPing as diplomats."

Suddenly, Richard felt a tap on his shoulder. He was so focused on the conversation with the homies that he almost jumped out of his shirt. "Hooooly shit."

The Italian guy cleared his throat. "Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. I feel the same way about this conference."
