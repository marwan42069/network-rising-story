*Mike sends Long and Richard to Abu Dhabi to a network state conference in order to scope out related projects who could collaborate and VCs who could invest more money into Networia. Richard has been forming his own opinions on what the network state means, so in his mind, he is there not for Networkia, but for himself to piece together all of the intertwining and parallel efforts to create the future of human organization. Richard meets a few crazy people until he stumbles upon someone who can help him put it all together.*

***Work in progress***

*December 15, 2025 â€” Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - Etihad Arena, main auditorium*

"Thank you again for having me here, now let's work together to make death a choice!" The remote speaker turned off his camera to indicate he was finished with his talk.

The audience roared in applause. Some people towards the front even stood up. 

Richard turned to Long with a quizzical expression on his face. Despite their company's alignment with the speaker's agenda, neither of them were applauding. "All these motherfuckers are just whoring themselves out for investment dollars. I thought these were supposed to be great minds architecting the future of humanity."

"We're strolling that street corner too, mate." Long looked back at Richard. He pointed to Richard's Networkia t-shirt and then at his own.

The applause finally quieted to a halt. Many of the people who stood up to applaud the speaker moved out of their seats towards the auditorium exit. 

Richard rolled his eyes. "Michael should have gotten his ass here instead of us. I don't want to listen to these shills circlejerk their meaningless projects."

"Well, feel free to get off your bleeding arse and talk to the other patrons." Long couldn't suppress his scowl quickly enough.

"Damn bro, yell at me why don't you." Richard grimaced.

Long then softened his expression a bit. "Honestly man, I don't mind taking technical notes if you want to talk to people about their projects."

"Our company is also on Ryan Johnsson's johnson."

Ayanah chuckled to herself. "Ryan Johnsson's on *my* johnson!" She thrust her thumb towards her chest. "He sent me a text message saying he wanted to invest in my company, so I told him more about it and I'm waiting for his reply!"

Richard furrowed his brow. *This bitch is fuckin' nuts, but she's a character for sure.* "Riiiiiiiight. The man didn't tell you to lose his number?"

"For real! I walked up to him and said \"So do you wanna die? I'm THE only woman with the technology to preserve your current form for fifty years.\""

Richard remained skeptical. "And he didn't just ignore you or tell you to shove it?"

"No 

<hr />

"So you're building a business platform for Africans to access the global market?"

Hans placed his first two forefingers on his temple. "It's so much more than that." He sighed a little. "We are providing an equitable virtual nation to empower skilled and ethical individuals and businesses all around the world!" 

"But you just told me all about your work connecting African developers to European businesses, you mentioned very little of the nation part and how this isn't just gonna end up an economic race-to-the-bottom."

"We have our clusters! They do social good and contribute and vote on social good missions with which they are aligned!"

*Alright then, I'm done with this guy's shit.* Richard looked at his watch as if to check the time for his next obligation. "I'm sorry man, I need to get going to the next talk." Richard stood up and extended his hand for a parting handshake. "Pleasure meeting you. *Auf wiedersehen*, buddy."
