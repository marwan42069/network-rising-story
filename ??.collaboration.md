*Mike sends Long and Richard Abu Dhabi to to a network state conference in order to scope out related projects who could collaborate and VCs who could invest more money into Networia. Richard has been forming his own opinions on what the network state means, so in his mind, he is there not for Networkia, but for himself to piece together all of the intertwining and parallel efforts to create the future of human organization.*

***Work in progress***

*December 15, 2025 â€” Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - Etihad Arena*

"Thank you again for having me present here, and let's work together to make death a choice!" The audience roared in applause.

As they sat in their seats with their laptops open, Richard turned to Long with a quizzical expression on his face. "All these motherfuckers are just shilling their projects."

"So are we, mate." Long pointed to Richard's Networkia t-shirt and then at his own.

Richard rolled his eyes. "Michael should have gotten his ass here instead of us. I don't want to listen to these shills circlejerk their meaningless projects."

"Well, feel free to get off your bleeding arse and talk to the other patrons." Long then softened his expression a bit. "Really man, I don't mind taking technical notes if you want to talk to people instead."

"Oh, so you're also on Ryan Johnsson's johnson?"

Ayanah chuckled to herself. "*Hail* no, Ryan Johnsson's on *my* johnson!" She thrust her thumb towards her chest. "He sent me a text message saying he wanted to invest in my company, so I told him more about it and I'm waiting for his reply!"

Richard furrowed his brow. *This bitch is fuckin' nuts, but she's a character for sure.* "Riiiiiiiight."

"For real! I walked up to him and said \"So do you wanna die?\" I'm THE only woman with the technology to preserve your current form for fifty years."

"So you're building a business platform for Africans to access the global market?"

Hans placed his first two forefingers on his temple. "It's so much more than that." He sighed a little. We are providing an equitable social good platform to empower skilled ethical individuals and businesses all over the world!"
